# File Processing Program

A simple Python utility that reads text files and creates modified versions with uppercase content. This program demonstrates file operations and error handling in Python.

## Features

python filehandling.py
```

2. When prompted:

   - Enter the name for the output file
   - Type 'quit' at any time to exit

## Error Handling

The program handles several common errors:
- File not found

- Other file operation errors

Error messages are user-friendly and clearly indicate what went wrong.
